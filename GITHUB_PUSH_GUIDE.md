## 📝 Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   - Open your browser
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - (If not logged in, log in first)

2. **Fill in Repository Details:**
   ```
   Repository name: tbibvision
   Description: 🏥 AI-Powered Medical Assistant - Lab analysis, skin check, and symptom checker
   Visibility: ⚪ Public (or 🔒 Private if you prefer)
   
   ❌ DO NOT initialize with README
   ❌ DO NOT add .gitignore
   ❌ DO NOT add license
   ```

3. **Click "Create repository"**

---

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you instructions. Follow these commands:

#### Option A: If you see the GitHub page with commands

Copy the commands from GitHub that look like this:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tbibvision.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### Option B: Manual Steps

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Add GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tbibvision.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

---

### Step 3: Run the Commands

**Open your terminal in the project folder** and run:

```powershell
# 1. Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tbibvision.git

# 2. Rename branch
git branch -M main

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**You'll be asked for credentials:**
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: Your Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password!)

---

### Step 4: Create GitHub Personal Access Token (If Needed)

If you don't have a token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: `TbibVision Push`
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

## 🔄 Making Changes Later

When you make changes to your code:

```bash
# 1. Check what changed
git status

git add .

# 3. Commit with message
git commit -m "Add new feature: XYZ"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push
```

## 📌 Important Notes

### ✅ What's on GitHub:
- Source code
- Documentation
- SQL scripts
- README with setup instructions

### ❌ What's NOT on GitHub (protected):
- `.env` files (API keys)
- `node_modules/` folders
- Uploaded files
- Any sensitive data

### 🔒 Security Reminders:
- ✅ Never commit `.env` files
- ✅ Never share API keys publicly
- ✅ Use environment variables for secrets
- ✅ Keep `.gitignore` updated

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "remote origin already exists"

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tbibvision.git
```

### Problem: "Permission denied"

- Make sure you're using a Personal Access Token, not your password
- Check if the token has `repo` scope
- Generate a new token if needed

### Problem: "Repository not found"

- Check the repository name matches exactly
- Make sure the repository was created on GitHub
- Verify your username in the URL
