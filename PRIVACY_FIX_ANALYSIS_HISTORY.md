# üîí PRIVACY FIX: User-Specific Analysis History

## ‚ùå **PROBLEM:**
- All users were seeing the SAME analysis history
- When User A logged in, they could see User B's analysis
- History was stored in **local storage** (device-specific, not user-specific)
- **Major privacy and security issue!**

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION:**

### **What Was Changed:**

#### **1. Updated `getAnalysisHistory()` function**
- **Before:** Fetched from AsyncStorage (shared across all accounts)
- **After:** Fetches from Supabase **filtered by user ID**

```javascript
// Now fetches only the current user's history
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('analysis_history')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)  // ‚Üê Only this user's data!
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(50);
```

#### **2. Updated `clearAnalysisHistory()` function**
- **Before:** Cleared ALL history from local storage
- **After:** Deletes only the current user's history from Supabase

```javascript
// Only deletes the current user's history
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('analysis_history')
  .delete()
  .eq('user_id', user.id);  // ‚Üê Security check!
```

#### **3. Updated `deleteAnalysis()` function**
- **Before:** Deleted from local storage
- **After:** Deletes from Supabase with user ID verification

```javascript
// Double check: analysis ID AND user ID must match
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('analysis_history')
  .delete()
  .eq('id', parseInt(analysisId))
  .eq('user_id', user.id);  // ‚Üê Can only delete own history!
```

## üéØ **WHAT THIS MEANS:**

### **For Users:**
- ‚úÖ Each user only sees **THEIR OWN** analysis history
- ‚úÖ User A cannot see User B's medical data
- ‚úÖ History is synced across devices (when logged in)
- ‚úÖ Guest users see nothing (must log in to save history)

### **For Privacy:**
- ‚úÖ Medical data is now **private** and **secure**
- ‚úÖ Row-Level Security (RLS) in Supabase enforces user isolation
- ‚úÖ No cross-contamination of sensitive medical information

---

## üì± **HOW TO TEST:**

1. **Login with User 1:**
   - Do some lab/skin analyses
   - Check Profile ‚Üí should see your history

2. **Logout and Login with User 2:**
   - Check Profile ‚Üí should see NO history (empty)
   - Do some analyses
   - Check Profile ‚Üí should see ONLY User 2's analyses

3. **Switch back to User 1:**
   - Check Profile ‚Üí should see ONLY User 1's history
   - User 2's analyses should NOT be visible

## üîê **SECURITY FEATURES:**

### **Database-Level Security:**
- Supabase RLS policies ensure users can only access their own data
- `user_id` foreign key links to `auth.users`

### **App-Level Security:**
- All queries filtered by `user.id`
- Double-check on delete operations
- Guest users cannot see any history

---

## ‚úÖ **TESTING CHECKLIST:**

- [ ] Login with first account
- [ ] Create some analyses
- [ ] See history in Profile
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Login with different account
- [ ] History should be empty
- [ ] Create some analyses for second account
- [ ] Logout and login with first account again
- [ ] Should see only first account's history

---

## üìä **RESULT:**

‚úÖ **Analysis history is now completely private and user-specific!**

Each user has their own isolated medical history.
