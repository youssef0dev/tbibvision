## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **AuthContext.js** - Disabled Email Confirmation
```javascript
// Updated signUp function
const signUp = async (email, password, fullName) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
    email,
    password,
    options: {
      data: { full_name: fullName },
      emailRedirectTo: undefined, // Disable email redirect
    },
  });
  // User can login immediately!
};
```

### 2. **App.js** - Smart Initial Route
```javascript
// Checks authentication and onboarding status
initialRouteName={
  user ? 'Main' :                    // Logged in → Go to app
  (hasSeenOnboarding ? 'Login' :     // Seen onboarding → Go to login
  'Splash')                          // First time → Show splash/onboarding
}
```

### 3. **SignupScreen.js** - Instant Entry
```javascript
// After successful signup
Alert.alert('Welcome! 🎉', 'Your account has been created successfully!', [
  { text: 'Get Started', onPress: () => navigation.replace('Main') }
]);
// User goes directly to Main app!
```

## 📋 Supabase Configuration Required

**IMPORTANT:** You must disable email confirmation in your Supabase Dashboard:

### Steps:
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project: `wxnfkimplrwizgehmfed`
3. Navigate to: **Authentication** > **Settings**
4. Find **"Email Auth"** section
5. **UNCHECK** "Enable email confirmations"
6. Click **"Save"**

### Verification:
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to check:
```sql
SELECT 
  email,
  created_at,
  email_confirmed_at,
  raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name' as full_name
FROM auth.users
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

If `email_confirmed_at` is NULL but users can login, it's working!
