# üîì DISABLE VERCEL DEPLOYMENT PROTECTION

## ‚ö†Ô∏è THE PROBLEM
Your Vercel backend shows "Authentication Required" - this means **Deployment Protection is enabled** and is blocking your mobile app from accessing the backend!

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Disable Deployment Protection

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open this link:** https://vercel.com/youssef-jarmounis-projects/backend/settings/deployment-protection

2. **You will see a page with "Deployment Protection" settings**

3. **Look for the toggle or dropdown** - it will say something like:
   - "Standard Protection" (currently enabled)
   - OR "Protection Level: All Deployments"

4. **CHANGE IT TO:**
   - **"Disabled"** (best option)
   - OR **"Only Preview Deployments"** (if you can't disable completely)

5. **Click "Save" button**

6. **VERIFY:**
   - The page should say "Deployment Protection: Disabled"
   - OR "Protection: Only Preview Deployments"

## üì± Why This Matters

Your mobile app needs PUBLIC access to the backend API. With protection enabled, every API request gets blocked with an authentication page - which your mobile app cannot pass through!

## ‚úÖ After You Disable It

Come back here and tell me "done" or "disabled" and I'll test if the backend is working!
